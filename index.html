          <h3><li><u><b>THEY HAVE GREAT CAMOUFLAGE FOR THEIR ENVIRONMENT.</b></u></li></h3><BR>
            <ul>
                <li><p>The giant panda's distinct black-and-white markings have two functions: camouflage and communication.<BR>
                    Most of the panda - its face, neck, belly, rump - is white to help it hide in snowy habitats.
                    The arms and<BR> legs are black, helping it to hide in shade.<BR></p> </li>

            <ul>

                    - with the cub resting on her front and remaining covered by her paw, arm or head. </p>
                </li><BR>
            </ul> 
            <h3><li><u><b>COURAGEOUS CUBS!</b></u></li></h3><BR>

        <ol>
            <h3><li><u><b>PIGEONS HAVE BEEN PRESENT WITH HUMANS SINCE AGES.</b></u></li></h3><BR>
            <ul>
                <li><P>The pigeons have been around humans for thousands of year. 5,000 years old Mesopotamian tablets <BR>
                    have been found illustrating domestication of rock doves, a breed of pigeon.</P><br>
                 </li> 
            </ul><BR>
            <h3><li><U><b>PIGEONS HAVE FOUGHT ALONGSIDE HUMANS IN WORLD WAR I AND II</b></U></li></h3><BR>
            <ul>
                <li><p>In a time where communication was difficult, pigeons were used to fly across borders to deliver <br>
                    messages to the military camp as well as to the allies. </li></p><BR>
            </ul> 
            <h3><li><u><b>NAVIGATIONAL TECHNIQUE</b></u></li></h3><BR>
            <ul>
                <li><p>The Pigeon racing events, as well as their involvement in the world wars, is all <BR>
                    because of their unique navigation skills.</p>
                </li><BR>
            </ul> 
            <h3><li><u><b>PIGEONS: RATS OF THE SKY</b></u></li></h3><BR>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Although Pigeons have been known for various good traits, one attribute that weighs them down is the role they<br>
                    play in creating the nuisance and transmitting diseases. Pigeon droppings and their feather becomes<br>
                    a hotbed for all types of bacteria and viruses.  </li></p><BR>
            </ul>
            <h3><li><u><b>PIGEONS RACES</b></u></li></h3><BR>
            <ul><li><p>Did you know there is a specific breed of Pigeons called Racing Homer that were and are still used in the sport<br> 
                of racing? It is a sport where the trained pigeons are raced and the distance covered and the time <br>
                taken is measured to evaluate the speed of all participant birds. </li></p></ul><BR>

        <ol>
            <h3><li><u><b>CAMELS DON'T STORE WATER IN THEIR HUMPS !!!</b></u></li></h3><BR>
            <ul>
                <li><p>The camel's hump is its most notable feature. However, contrary to popular belief, it isn't used to store water.<br>
                  Instead, the hump stores fat.The fat releases both energy and water when resources are unavailable.  <BR></p>
                    
                 </li> 
            </ul><BR>
            <h3><li><U><b>THEY CAN HYDRATE QUICKLY</b></U></li></h3><BR>
            <ul>
                <li><p>While camels don’t store water in their humps, these desert animals are great at conserving water. Dromedary<br> 
                    camels use heterothermy to regulate their body temperature throughout the day.This prevents them from sweating during daily increases in temperature, conserving water.<br>                   
                    When a camel does come across water, it can fill up in a hurry, drinking as much as 26 gallons in 10 minutes.<br></p>
                     </li>
            </ul> 
            <h3><li><u><b>CAMELS ARE SOCIAL ANIMALS </b></u></li></h3><BR>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Camels travel in herds. Groups are composed of as many as 30 individuals including a family unit with one dominant male. <BR>
                    They don’t just travel together; camels also communicate with members of their group by making sounds like moans and bellows.<br></p>
                </li><BR>
            </ul> 
            <h3><li><u><b>THEY DO THE HEAVY LIFTING</b></u></li></h3><BR>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Camels have an impressive ability to carry a heavy load. The Bactrian camel can carry up to 440 pounds in a day, while the dromedary <br>
                    can haul up to 220 pounds.<br></p>
                    </li>
            </ul>
            <h3><li><u><b>THE WILD BACTERIAN CAMEL IS CRITICALLY ENDANGERED</b></u></li></h3><BR>
            <ul><li><p>Though most camels are domesticated, the small number of wild Bactrian camels remaining are critically endangered.<br> 
                There are estimated to be fewer than 1,000 wild Bactrian camels remaining, and their population is expected to decrease by as much<br>
                as 80 percent over the next 45 to 50 years. </li></p></ul><BR>
